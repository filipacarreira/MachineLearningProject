 Welcome to TechScape. In the beginning of 2020, five Portuguese entrepreneurs built a startup to sell goods related to digital detox. Using an online store, TechScape sells products and services which will allow their customers to stay focused on the most important things and improve the balance with technology use in their lives, such as meditation kits, books, stress balls, ”dumb” phones, retreats, among others. With the emergence of Covid-19 in March 2020, the company had some financial difficulties, and they were out of function in April 2020. But in May 2020, they restarted their activities, knowing that a digital detox is becoming even more critical in this period of time, where people need to unplug themselves and improve their quality of life. Focused in increasing their sales, TechScape hired a team of data scientists to analyze the online behavior of their customers and to predict which customers have a high probability of buying their products depending on their online actions.
